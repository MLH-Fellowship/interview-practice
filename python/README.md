## Further Note
If you want to use a custom domain. In track_record/settings.py you can see to the line number 36. Even if you are getting any error related to cors-header 
```
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
      "put your frontend domain link here to get the data"
]

CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
      "put your frontend domain link here to get the data" 
]
```
Add this line in the settings.py file and comment the line no. 32 in settings.py file that not allow any domain to use that particular api
